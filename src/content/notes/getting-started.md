# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern web framework for building fast, content-focused websites. It combines the best of static site generation with component-based architecture.

## Why Astro?

- **Zero JavaScript by default** - Ship less JavaScript, get better performance
- **Component Islands** - Use any framework (React, Vue, Svelte) where you need it
- **Content Collections** - Type-safe markdown with automatic validation

## Key Concepts

### Components

Astro components use a `.astro` extension and combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file. The component syntax uses frontmatter for logic and template syntax for markup.

### Content Collections

Content Collections provide a type-safe way to work with markdown files. Define schemas, get autocomplete, and ensure your content matches your expectations.

### Static Generation

By default, Astro pre-renders all pages at build time, resulting in fast page loads and excellent SEO.
